# Walmart Sales Data Analysis with Python and SQL  

## Project Overview  
This project is an **end-to-end data analysis solution** designed to extract business insights from Walmart sales data. Using **Python** and **MySQL**, the project demonstrates how to process, clean, and analyze data to answer critical business questions.  

The workflow involves:  
- **Data Collection:** Utilizing datasets (e.g., from Kaggle).  
- **Data Processing:** Cleaning and transforming data using Python libraries like Pandas and SQLAlchemy.  
- **Database Management:** Loading data into relational databases (MySQL).  
- **Advanced Querying:** Using SQL for analytics, including aggregation functions, window functions, and date operations.  

This project is ideal for data analysts aiming to develop skills in **data manipulation, SQL querying, and building data pipelines**.

## Insights from SQL Queries  
Below are some insights you can derive using the provided queries in `queries.sql`:

1. **Top Performing Branches by Revenue**  
   ```sql
   SELECT branch, SUM(total) AS total_revenue
   FROM walmart
   GROUP BY branch
   ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

2. **Most Popular Product Categories**  
   ```sql
   SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS total_sales
   FROM walmart
   GROUP BY category
   ORDER BY total_sales DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. **Monthly Revenue Trends**  
   ```sql
   SELECT DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m') AS month, SUM(total) AS total_revenue
   FROM walmart
   GROUP BY month
   ORDER BY month ASC;
   ```
