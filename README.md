Walmart-Analytics-Project

Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract business insights from Walmart sales data. Using Python and MySQL, the project demonstrates how to process, clean, and analyze data to answer critical business questions.

The workflow involves:

Data Collection: Utilizing datasets (e.g., from Kaggle).
Data Processing: Cleaning and transforming data using Python libraries like Pandas and SQLAlchemy.
Database Management: Loading data into relational databases (MySQL).
Advanced Querying: Using SQL for analytics, including aggregation functions, window functions, and date operations.
This project is ideal for data analysts aiming to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and building data pipelines.

Project Structure
data/: Contains raw datasets used for the analysis.
scripts/: Python scripts for cleaning, transforming, and loading data.
queries.sql: SQL queries for deriving insights.
results/: Outputs and visualizations generated from the analysis.
